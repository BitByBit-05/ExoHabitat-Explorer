# ExoHabitat Explorer

## Overview
The "ExoHabitat Explorer" program is designed to determine the habitability of exoplanets by asking a series of 40 questions related to the planet's suitability for supporting human life. The program also calculates the planet's gravity based on its mass and radius.

## Versions
The program is available in two versions: a Command Line Interface (CLI) version and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version.

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Version
The CLI version of the program is designed for use in a command-line environment. It guides the user through a series of questions about an exoplanet and calculates a score based on the answers, including considerations like habitable zone, atmosphere, water availability, gravity, and more. It keeps track of data in a txt file, named DATABASE where the score of hosting life and the exoplanets/planets name is stored.

To run the CLI version:
1. Compile the Main.java file: `javac Main.java`
2. Run the compiled program: `java Main`

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version

The GUI version provides a more interactive and user-friendly experience for determining the habitability of exoplanets. Users can input the relevant data via a graphical interface, and the program calculates the habitability score accordingly.

To run the GUI version:
1. Compile the Main_gui file
2. Run the compiled program

## Usage
Both versions of the program will guide the user through a series of questions regarding an exoplanet's characteristics. The questions cover a wide range of factors relevant to human habitability, including gravity, surface conditions, atmosphere, resources, and more.

The program calculates a final score based on the user's responses to help determine the exoplanet's suitability for human life support and potential colonization.
